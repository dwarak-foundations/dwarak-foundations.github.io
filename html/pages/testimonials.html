                                    process was very cumbersome and hectic. He took us through a smooth path with
                                    minimal exposure to difficulties and started the construction in record time.
                                    A total of 14 flats - all 2 and 3 bedroom configurations were built in the project
                                    on 4.33 grounds. These buildings stand tall in the area when it comes to appearance
                                    and quality. We sold every unit and the buyers are happy customers. Even after the
                                    project was over, Mr. Varadharajan was called by the buyers to resolve few issues
                                    and he showed up with a smiling face and resolved their issues.

                                    formalities were taken care with much ease and it was a great help to me and my wife
                                    as retired people. We wish Dwarak Foundations a great future and would recommend
                                    them for anyone without any reservations.</p>
